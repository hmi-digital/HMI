Next Generation Human Machine Interfaces

The term Human-Machine Interface (“HMI”) describes the methods in which people interact with machines, and is a subset of the broader User Interface (“UI”) field.

Progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are profoundly impacting the human-machine interfaces. Organizations must design interaction that are multimodal, natural language and personalized one.

The goal of natural language (NL) and multimodal interface (Speech recognition, Keyboard, mouse entry, among others) is to enable ease-of-use for users in performing human-computer interactions.
